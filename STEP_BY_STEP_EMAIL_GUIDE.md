### **🟡 APPROACH 2: Superior University Email (50% Success Rate)**

**Current Issues with Your Setup:**
- ❌ Using regular password instead of app password
- ❌ University may block external SMTP access
- ❌ Wrong SMTP server configuration

**Step-by-Step Superior Email Setup:**

#### Step 1: Contact Superior IT Department
```
Ask them for:
- SMTP server address (smtp.superior.edu.pk or smtp.office365.com)
- SMTP port (usually 587 or 465)
- Security settings (SSL/TLS requirements)
- Whether external applications are allowed
```

#### Step 2: Check if Superior Uses Office365
```
Many universities use Microsoft Office365
If yes, try these settings in .env.local:

EMAIL_USER=su92-bssem-f22-218@superior.edu.pk
EMAIL_PASS=ahmad2414
SMTP_HOST=smtp.office365.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

#### Step 3: Enable App Passwords (if available)
```
1. Login to Superior email portal
2. Look for "Security" or "App passwords"
3. Generate app password for "Mail applications"
4. Replace ahmad2414 with the generated password
```

#### Step 4: Test Current Setup
```
Your current setup might work if Superior allows it:
- The API will try Office365 SMTP automatically
- Check terminal for error messages
- Look for authentication failures
```
